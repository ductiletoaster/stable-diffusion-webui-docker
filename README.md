# ComfyUI Docker

A Docker-based setup for running [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI), a powerful and modular stable diffusion GUI and backend.

## About ComfyUI

ComfyUI is a powerful and modular stable diffusion GUI and backend with a graph/nodes interface. This Docker setup provides an easy way to run ComfyUI with GPU acceleration or CPU-only mode, complete with model management and persistent storage.

### Key Features
- **Node-based workflow editor** - Visual programming interface for AI image generation
- **GPU & CPU support** - Optimized for NVIDIA GPUs with CPU fallback
- **Model management** - Automated model downloading and organization
- **Persistent storage** - Your models, configs, and outputs are preserved
- **Easy deployment** - Single command setup with Docker Compose
